# NOTES:
# - All services must run the same project, docker swarm doesn't seem to automatically 
#   assign project names. Manager filters events on project name to detect workers and add them to master. 
#
# - Docker python API only gets events from the node it is on. Temporary solution: change deploy mode to 
#   global so all nodes have a manager. Better solution: single manager node which gets events from all swarm nodes, 
#   solution seems non obvious and the temp fix was easy enough. 
# 
# - If a worker is stood up before the mananger starts to look for workers, the worker may not be added 
#   (depends_on is ignored on compose 3), temporary solution is to scale workers to 0 and back to a normal
#   scale. Better solution: update manager with a smarter protocol for adding workers.
